    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Customized Training for Labour Officers</h4>
      <p>
        We develop and lead internal training and certification programs for labour officers and inspectors.
        These programs enhance analytical capacity and introduce digital tools such as geo-mapping to boost
        enforcement of labour laws and enable data-driven interventions.

      <h4>Youth Employment and Soft Skills Development</h4>
      <p>
        Understanding the importance of workplace readiness, Nexus has designed programs for unattached youth focusing on
        soft skills such as work ethics, interview techniques, and self-confidence. These are followed by job fairs aimed
        at connecting youth with employment opportunities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h4>Public Education and Outreach</h4>
      <p>
        Nexus plays a leading role in organizing roadshows, workshops, and media campaigns to raise awareness about labour rights.
        These efforts promote flexible work arrangements and build a culture of compliance among employers and workers alike.
